Privacy Policy for Utility for Stadia Controller

Last Updated: 6/1/2026

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Utility for Stadia Controller" project ("we," "us," or "the Tool") handles information when you use the software provided in this repository or the associated browser extension.

1. Our Commitment to Privacy
We believe that your data belongs to you. The Utility for Stadia Controller is designed as a client-side tool. This means that the logic and processing required to interact with your Stadia Controller happen locally on your machine.

2. Information We Collect
The Tool does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

No Personal Information: We do not collect names, email addresses, IP addresses, or any other identifying information.

No Tracking: We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or analytics (such as Google Analytics) to monitor your usage.

No Backend Storage: There is no remote database where your controller information or usage history is stored.

3. Device Data and Permissions
To function, the Tool requires access to specific hardware interfaces via your web browser:

WebHID / WebUSB API: The Tool uses these browser APIs to communicate directly with your Stadia Controller via a USB cable. This access is only used to facilitate controller configuration, firmware updates, or mode switching.

Local Processing: Any data read from the controller (such as serial numbers or hardware versions) remains in your browser's memory and is discarded when the session is closed.

4. Third-Party Services
This Tool is an independent project and is not affiliated with, authorized, or endorsed by Google LLC. However, because the Tool interacts with official Stadia Controller hardware, your browser may communicate with Google’s servers if you are redirected to the official Stadia Bluetooth mode update page. Please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy for how they handle data on their domains.

5. Data Security
Because we do not collect or store your data, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised from our side. We recommend only using this Tool on secure, trusted devices and keeping your browser updated to the latest version.

6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Tool's functionality. Any updates will be posted directly to the GitHub repository with a revised "Last Updated" date.

7. Contact Information
